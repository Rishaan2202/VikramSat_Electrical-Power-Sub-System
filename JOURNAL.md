# July 1, 2025, Getting Started!!!
I guess all the necessary information about this repository was available on README.md but whatever, there should not be laziness just for the introduction again, so here it is. I am Rishaan Sharma, aged 14, working on the VikranSat.v0 with 4 of my friendzzz. I have been assigned the responsibility to make the Electrical Power Sub-System of the CubeSat. Yup it is a big duty, but I am up to it with all my patience and hardwork. I have made the whole EPS PCB Schematic 3 times in the past, and yes, It's me building it again for the fourth time due to some technical glitches. I will Keep you updated each time I do something. That's all for today, we'll meet again very soon!!!

Yeahhhh!, I'm back with something interesting. I finalised the 3.3V buck converter for the load. Also did some meeting kinda stuff with the project head and we finalised to have RP2350A as the power management IC. Negligible work done on the schematic today. Nevermind, just take a look:-

Yoooo!!! Today I kinda wasted my time just to add this RP2350A PMIC to my schematic, cause I'm just 14 and struggling to find my way in this electrc world. Whatever, just see this:-

Yeah, It's me again!!! Today I made the Battery Protection unit. Well that's just a BMS kinda IC, but I like exagerrating names, so yeah, see this:-

How're you all!!! I am here today with the completion of the C-Type Receptacle on the schematic. Well, we haven't figured out anything about the PMIC(RP2350A), as we have to change it because of it's power consumption. Well, here's the schematic of the day:-

# July 23, 2025, Day-13!
I'm back with only a bit things done today. Well I was guided to add LICENSE and README.md in this repository. I also had a meeting with my teammates to figure out if there was something wrong with the power board, and fortunately, there wasn't any flaw, just the values of some components were not fixed as I was not able to figure them out, but hopefully I guess they will be fixed after a few tutorials. Well, I also did very minor changes to the C-Type receptacle today. There's nothing to see in it, but just see it:-

# July 24, 2025, Day-13!
I'm back today with a good news that I found a very nice Power Management IC which is STPMIC1A, for the EPS. I also did all the connections of the current sensors. The schematic looks like a monster now, take a look:-
