# July 1, 2025, Getting Started!!!
Meet me, I am Rishaan Sharma, aged 14, working on the VikranSat v0 with 4 of my friendzzz. I have been assigned the responsibility to make the Electrical Power Sub-System of the CubeSat. Yup it is a big duty, but I am up to it with all my patience and hardwork. I have made the whole EPS PCB Schematic 3 times in the past, and yes, It's me building it again for the fourth time due to some technical glitches. I will Keep you updated each time I do something. That's all for today, we'll meet again very soon!!!
