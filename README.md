# VikramSat.v0 EPS Journal!!!
<br>
Yooooo!!! It's me, Rishaan Sharma, a 14 year old Indian boy making a satellite with 4 of my teammates.
<br>
The Satellite is named as 'VikramSat'. It's a 2U CubeSat and yeah it's quite a cool project!
<br>
<br>
I have been assigned the duty to make a fully functional Electrical Power Sub-System (EPS) for the CubeSat.
<br>
<br>
So, I'm writing this journal which notifies about the progress regularly.
<br>
I hope you all will find this quite interesting. For more details do view JOURNAL.md in this repository containing the journal.
